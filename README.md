A simple simulator of the Bataille card game, also known as [War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)). User can set the number of suits and cards per suit as well as the number of jokers in the deck of cards. It is also possible to define an arbitrary number of players for a game. At the end of each round, the winner puts the played cards in random order at the bottom of their card stack.
